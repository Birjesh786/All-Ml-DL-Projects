## 🤖 Project 1: Algorithmic Trading with Top Stocks 

[Project Link](https://github.com/Birjesh786/All-Ml-DL-Projects/blob/main/Algorithmic_Trading_with_Top_Stocks.ipynb) 

👉 Category: **Deep Learning**

🖋️ Description:

**Project Overview**: Momentum-Based Stock Price Prediction

The project aims to create a comprehensive stock price prediction model based on the ground-breaking **Momentum Strategy idea**.

The model includes a wide range of analytical methods, such as volume analysis and in-depth investigation of open and close rates.

**Comprehensive Analysis Coverage:**

1. Volume analysis is a thorough investigation of trade volume trends that provides a deeper understanding of market dynamics and investor sentiment.

2. An in-depth analysis of opening and closing price movements that reveals intraday volatility and prospective trading opportunities is known as a "**open-and-close rate analysis.**"

**Special Mention**: Momentum Strategy

Overview of Momentum Strategy The Momentum Strategy, a renowned trading strategy based on profiting on asset prices' propensity to maintain their current directional momentum, is at the centre of the initiative.

The fundamental tenet of momentum trading is that it involves carefully purchasing assets that have shown a decrease in value while simultaneously disposing of assets that have shown an increase in value.


## 🤖 Project 2: Language Detection

[Project Link](https://github.com/Birjesh786/All-Ml-DL-Projects/blob/main/Language_Detection.ipynb) 

👉 Category: **NLP**

🖋️ Description:

With the aid of NLP, I developed a Language Detection model for this project.

I used the multinomial MB algorithm in my project. Since this technique consistently delivers excellent results on multiclass classification-based challenges, it is primarily reliant on training a language identification model.

In this project, I've only included 1000 sentences in each of the 22 most widely spoken languages. I obtained this data from Kaggle, too.

## 🤖 Project 3: Spam Comment Detection

[Project Link](https://github.com/Birjesh786/Spam_Comment_Classifier)

👉 Category: **ML + NLP**

🖋️ Description:

In this project, I'm creating a spam classifier model based on two approaches:

1. With a labelled dataset

2. Without a labelled dataset
